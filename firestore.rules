/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the Safety Guardian application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on a strict user-ownership principle for personal data,
 * combined with a Database-Based Access Control (DBAC) system for roles like
 * 'Supervisor' and 'SafetyManager'. This ensures that users can only access their
 * own information, while allowing privileged roles to view and manage specific data,
 * such as safety checklists, as part of the application's workflow.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/checklists/{checklistId}: Checklists created by a specific user.
 * - /checklist_templates: Global, read-only templates available to all users.
 * - /roles_supervisor, /roles_safetymanager: Collections used for DBAC lookups. The
 *   existence of a document in these collections grants a user the corresponding role.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only access documents under their own path (`/users/{userId}`).
 *   Listing all users is explicitly disallowed to prevent user enumeration.
 * - Role-Based Access: Supervisors and Safety Managers are granted read and update
 *   permissions on checklists to facilitate approval workflows. These roles are
 *   managed in dedicated collections.
 * - Read-Only Global Data: Checklist templates are readable by all signed-in users but
 *   are not writable from the client, ensuring their integrity.
 * - Secure Role Management: The role collections (`/roles_*`) are locked down entirely
 *   from client-side writes. Roles must be assigned using a trusted server environment
 *   (e.g., Cloud Functions or the Admin SDK) to prevent self-escalation of privileges.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: Checklists contain a `userId` field, and roles
 *   are stored in separate collections. This avoids costly and slow `get()` calls in
 *   rules, leading to better performance and simpler logic.
